echo "7. FRAMEWORK ENHANCEMENTS SUMMARY"
echo "----------------------------------"
cat << EOF
🎯 EXPAND TEST COVERAGE:
   - Added stress tests for IPC, memory, and system operations
   - Implemented boundary condition and error recovery tests
   - Created comprehensive test suite runner with categorization

📊 ADD PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS:
   - Enhanced testlib with timing and benchmarking infrastructure
   - Implemented IPC throughput and latency benchmarks
   - Added memory allocation and access pattern benchmarks
   - Created task and system call performance tests

🤖 AUTOMATE TEST EXECUTION:
   - Comprehensive test runner with categorization and reporting
   - JSON and HTML report generation for test results
   - Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline via Make targets
   - Performance tracking and regression detection capabilities

🏗️  BUILD ON EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE:
   - Extended existing testlib.c/h with minimal changes
   - Integrated with user-qemu.mk build system
   - Compatible with QEMU-based test execution
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing tests
