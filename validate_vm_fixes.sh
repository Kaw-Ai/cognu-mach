echo "=== Summary ==="
echo "The implementation provides:"
echo "• Safe wrapper functions for resident page count updates"
echo "• Graceful recovery from count inconsistencies instead of panicking"
echo "• Detailed memory statistics collection for VM objects"
echo "• Integration with existing memory tracking system"
echo "• Memory pressure detection with VM object awareness"
echo "• Comprehensive test suite for validation"
echo
echo "These changes address the three main requirements:"
echo "1. ✓ Fixed page counting inconsistencies"
echo "2. ✓ Implemented accurate memory reporting"  
echo "3. ✓ Added memory pressure detection"
echo
echo "The implementation prevents system crashes while providing"
echo "detailed diagnostics and proactive memory management."
