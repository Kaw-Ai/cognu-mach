# Boot and Kernel Modules

The boot process loads the Mach kernel and its modules, establishes bootstrap ports, and starts the initial user task.

## Boot Flow (Mermaid)
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Bootloader] --> B[Load Mach kernel + modules]
  B --> C[Transfer control to kernel]
  C --> D[Initialize VM, IPC, devices, scheduler]
  D --> E[Create bootstrap ports]
  E --> F[Launch bootstrap task]
  F --> G[User space servers start (e.g., Hurd)]
```

## Modules
- Loadable modules provide drivers and kernel extensions.
- Configuration and compilation affect which drivers are in-kernel vs user-space.

## Bootstrap
- Bootstrap task receives privileged ports to locate/start core servers.
- Syscall emulation support may be provided for compatibility layers.
