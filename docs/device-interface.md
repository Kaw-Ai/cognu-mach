# Device Interface

Devices are accessed via device ports using the Mach device interface (open, close, read, write, map, status, filter).

## Common Operations
- device_open/device_close
- device_read/device_write
- device_map: map device memory into task address space
- device_get_status/device_set_status
- device_set_filter

## Access Flow (Mermaid Sequence)

  participant C as Client Task
  participant K as Mach Kernel
  participant D as Device Driver

  C->>K: device_open(name) -> device_port
  C->>K: device_read(device_port, ...)
  K->>D: driver backend call / message
  D-->>K: data
  K-->>C: data
```

## Components (PlantUML)
```plantuml
@startuml
component "Device Interface" as Dev
component "Driver Backend" as Drv
actor Client

Client --> Dev : device_* ops
Dev --> Drv : dispatch

```

Note: Depending on configuration, drivers may be in-kernel or proxied to user-space servers.
