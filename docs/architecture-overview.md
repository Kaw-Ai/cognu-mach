# GNU Mach Architecture Overview

This overview connects the major subsystems of the GNU Mach microkernel: tasks/threads, IPC/ports, virtual memory, scheduling/processor sets, device interface, host interface, bootstrap, and debugging.

- Microkernel responsibilities: IPC, VM, scheduling, basic devices, timing, and host control.
- User space responsibilities: servers (e.g., filesystems, network stacks) and applications built atop IPC.

## Component Relationships (PlantUML)
```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam componentStyle rectangle

package "User Space" {
  [Client Tasks] as Clients
  [Servers] as Servers
}

component "GNU Mach Microkernel" as Kernel
component "IPC (Ports/Messages)" as IPC
component "Virtual Memory" as VM
component "Scheduler" as Sched
component "Device Interface" as Dev
component "Host Interface" as Host
component "Kernel Debugger" as Kdb

Clients --> IPC : mach_msg(send)
Servers --> IPC : mach_msg(recv)
IPC --> Kernel
Kernel -- VM

Kernel -- Dev
Kernel -- Host

Dev .. Clients : device_* operations
Dev .. Servers : device_* operations
VM .. Servers : memory_object_* callbacks
Sched .. Clients

## Notes
- Ports mediate all capabilities: a port right (send/receive/send-once) is required to communicate or control a resource.
- VM integrates with external pagers via memory objects and the default memory manager.
- Scheduling is policy-driven and can be scoped to processor sets.
- Devices are accessed through device ports; implementations may reside in-kernel or be proxied to user-space drivers, depending on configuration.
