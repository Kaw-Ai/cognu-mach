# Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

GNU Mach IPC is capability-based message passing over ports. Port rights govern who may send, receive, or receive a single reply.

## Core Concepts
- Port: kernel-managed message queue and capability endpoint.
- Rights: send, receive, send-once; port sets aggregate receive rights for demultiplexing.
- Messages: typed descriptors with port rights and out-of-line memory.
- Notifications: async events (e.g., dead-name, no-senders) requested by tasks.

## Message Exchange (Mermaid Sequence)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant C as Client Task
  participant K as Mach Kernel
  participant S as Server Task

  C->>K: mach_msg(request, port_name=service_port, right=SEND)
  K-->>S: deliver to receive right (queue -> thread)
  S->>K: mach_msg(reply, port_name=reply_port, right=SEND_ONCE)
  K-->>C: deliver reply to waiting thread
```

## Port and Rights Model (PlantUML)
```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0

class Port {
  - queue
  - message_count
  - refcounts
}

class PortName {
  + name: mach_port_name_t
  + rights: {SEND, RECEIVE, SEND_ONCE}
}

enum RightType {
  SEND
  RECEIVE
  SEND_ONCE
}

class Task {
  + ipc_space : name->right mapping
}

Task "1" o-- "*" PortName : owns names
PortName --> Port : names map to ports

note right: A port may be referenced by many tasks via SEND rights.

## Receive Demultiplexing via Port Sets
- A port set groups multiple receive rights into a single receive queue.
- Servers typically wait on one port set and demux based on message ID.

## Message Format
- Header: destination port, reply port, message ID, size.
- Body: inline data, OOL memory, port descriptors.
- Atomicity: send and receive operations are atomic with respect to the destination port.

## Notifications
- Examples: dead-name, no-senders, send-once notifications.
- Requested by setting notification ports; delivered as normal messages.
