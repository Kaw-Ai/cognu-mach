# Host Interface

Operations for system-wide control and information, exposed via host ports.

## Host Operations
- host_information: CPU/memory stats, scheduling info.
- host_get_time / host_set_time.
- host_reboot.
- host-ports discovery and capabilities.

## Example Interactions (Mermaid)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant T as Task
  participant K as Mach Kernel

  T->>K: host_get_host_priv_port()
  K-->>T: host_priv_port
  T->>K: host_get_time(host_priv_port)
  K-->>T: timebase
  T->>K: host_reboot(host_priv_port)
```

## Components (PlantUML)
