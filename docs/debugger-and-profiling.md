# Kernel Debugger and Profiling

GNU Mach includes a built-in kernel debugger and profiling support.

## Kernel Debugger
- Commands: inspect state, memory, ports, threads, tasks.
- Variables/expressions and command scripting.
- Can be entered via key sequence, panic, or explicit triggers.

### Enter/Exit Flow (Mermaid)

sequenceDiagram
  participant OP as Operator
  participant K as Kernel
  OP->>K: trigger (keyboard/serial/panic)
  K-->>OP: KDB prompt
  OP->>K: commands
  K-->>OP: output
```

## Profiling
- Collect scheduling and VM events for analysis.
- Profiling control via kernel interfaces.
