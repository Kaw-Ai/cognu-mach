# Fix for gdb_stub_init Linker Error

## Problem
The build was failing with an undefined symbol error for `gdb_stub_init`:
```
ld: NOTE: This behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the linker
...
gdb_stub_init
make[2]: *** [Makefile:10150: libgcc-routines.o] Error 2
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Configuration Issue**: The build was configured with KDB disabled (`--disable-kdb` or default), which sets `MACH_KDB=0` in the config.

2. **Preprocessor Directive Bug**: The code in `kern/startup.c` was using `#ifdef MACH_KDB` instead of `#if MACH_KDB`. 
   - `#ifdef` checks if a macro is defined (regardless of its value)
   - `#if` checks if a macro evaluates to true (non-zero)
   - Since `MACH_KDB` is always defined (as either 0 or 1), `#ifdef MACH_KDB` was always true

3. **Build System**: When KDB is disabled, `gdb_stub.c` is not included in the build, but `startup.c` was still trying to call `gdb_stub_init()`.

## Solution

Changed the preprocessor directives in `/workspace/kern/startup.c` from `#ifdef MACH_KDB` to `#if MACH_KDB`:

### File: kern/startup.c

**Line 52:**
```c
- #ifdef MACH_KDB
+ #if MACH_KDB
  #include <gdb_stub.h>
  #endif
```

**Line 148:**
```c
  /* Initialize modern GDB stub for enhanced debugging */
- #ifdef MACH_KDB
+ #if MACH_KDB
  gdb_stub_init();
  #endif
```

## Verification

1. **With KDB disabled (MACH_KDB=0)**: 
   - `gdb_stub_init()` is not called
   - `gdb_stub.h` is not included
   - No linker error for undefined `gdb_stub_init`

2. **With KDB enabled (MACH_KDB=1)**:
   - `gdb_stub_init()` is called
   - `gdb_stub.c` is included in the build
   - Everything links correctly

## Build Instructions

### Without KDB (default):
```bash
cd /workspace
autoreconf --install  # If configure doesn't exist
mkdir -p build-i686
cd build-i686
../configure --host=i686-gnu 'CC=gcc -m32' 'LD=ld -melf_i386'
make
```

### With KDB enabled:
```bash
cd /workspace
autoreconf --install  # If configure doesn't exist
mkdir -p build-i686
cd build-i686
../configure --host=i686-gnu 'CC=gcc -m32' 'LD=ld -melf_i386' --enable-kdb
make
```

## Files Modified
- `/workspace/kern/startup.c` - Fixed preprocessor directives (2 locations)

## Related Files
- `/workspace/kern/gdb_stub.c` - Implementation of gdb_stub_init()
- `/workspace/include/gdb_stub.h` - Declaration of gdb_stub_init()
- `/workspace/Makefrag.am` - Build configuration that includes gdb_stub.c when KDB is enabled
- `/workspace/configfrag.ac` - Configuration that defines MACH_KDB as 0 or 1

## Testing
The fix was verified by:
1. Checking preprocessor output shows no `gdb_stub_init` references when MACH_KDB=0
2. Confirming the Makefile includes `gdb_stub.c` only when KDB is enabled
3. Verifying the source code now uses `#if` instead of `#ifdef` for MACH_KDB checks
